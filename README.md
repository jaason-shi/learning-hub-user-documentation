## How We Collaborated Together

We collaborated together during class time as well as communications over Discord. We also used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the project. We used the GitHub project board to track our progress and assign tasks to each other. We also used the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs and issues that we encountered during the development process. We would also create a new page for each section to minimize merge conflicts.
